;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the command `math-delimiters-insert' to
;; insert TeX/LaTeX math delimiters. This command is meant to be bound
;; to $ in buffers where the user wants to use it. The author, for
;; example, binds it in `LaTeX-mode-map' and in `org-mode-map'.
;;
;; Note that the excellent `cdlatex' includes a `cdlatex-dollar'
;; command that it binds to $.  Users of both packages will probably
;; want to unbind $ in `cdlatex-mode-map'.
;;
;; The delimiters used for inline math and display math by
;; `math-delimiters-insert' are customizable, defaulting to \(...\) and
;; \[...\] respectively.  A command `math-delimiters-toggle' is
;; provided to quickly toggle between $...$ and \(...\) for inline
;; math and between $$...$$ and \[...\] for display math.
;;
;; By default, inline math is translated into display math with no
;; additional line breaks. This can be modified by setting
;; `math-delimiters-compressed-display-math' to `nil'. For example,
;; expression of the form \(...\) will then be translated to
;; \n\[\n...\n\]\n.
;;
;; When translating inline math to display math, often it is desirable
;; to include punctuation into the display math and exclude it from of
;; the inline math environment. For that purpose, the variable
;; `math-delimiters-include-characters' is available; it takes a list of
;; characters to act upon.  For example, setting it to (list ?.) and
;; then toggling to display math on the expression "\(\eta\)." would
;; turn it into "\[\eta.\]" .
;;
;; Finally, a command `math-delimiters-no-dollars' is provided to
;; replace all $...$ and $$...$$ delimiters with \(...\) and \[...\],
;; respectively.
